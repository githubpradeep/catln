# Contributing

Catln is an early project and we welcome anyone interested in contributing.

You can submit feature requests or bug reports by opening an issue on Github. Please check if a similar issue already exists first.

### Pull Requests

If you want to submit code or have implemented a fix, open a pull request.

When writing your pull request, it helps to format and test it before it is submitted. You can do this by running:

```
make format
stack test --pedantic
```

If you are having difficulties getting it working, you can also open up a draft pull request in Github to share your code while you are finishing it.
