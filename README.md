# Catln

Catln is a new paradigm of programming languages based around the idea of term rewriting.
The language focuses at a high level on the expression of ideas.
It can encode ideas that are impossible to describe in most other languages and avoids low-level ideas that other languages leave you no choice but to express.
It is most similar to the functional programming languages, but is not technically based around functions.

**The language is currently under development. Only some of the critical language features have been implemented in the compiler so code written in the language is still somewhat limited.**

Right now, the team developing Catln consists of @zachgk and @githubpradeep.

Feel free to reach out to us on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/catln/shared_invite/zt-qkfr40mp-e7kIhGWYJK03RjUrYFRTDQ) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zachgk/catln/discussions) if you have any thoughts, ideas, questions, suggestions, feedback, or concerns about the language. You can also join to discuss programming language design, if you are interested in contributing to the language, or are interested in joining the Catln team.
