# Catln

Catln is a new paradigm of programming languages based around the idea of implicit conversions.
The language focuses at a high level on the expression of ideas.
It can encode ideas that are impossible to describe in most other languages and avoids low-level ideas that other languages leave you no choice but to express.
It is most similar to the functional programming languages, but is not technically based around functions.

### [Visit the docs site to learn about the language](https://zachgk.github.io/catln/)

**The language is currently under development. Only some of the critical language features have been implemented in the compiler so code written in the language is still somewhat limited.**

Contact [@zachgk](mailto:zachary@kimberg.com) if you have any thoughts, ideas, questions, feedback, or concerns about the language. I am also looking for collaborators so let me know if you have any interest in working on the language with me.
