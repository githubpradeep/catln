# Docs

This directory contains a number of documents describing the project.

## [Code Organization](organization.md)

## Philosophy

We have described a number of the core ideas and inspirations that motivate this project in the [philosphy section](philosphy/README.md). This can also be treated as a sort of roadmap to describe where the project is going in the future. As the status of the project is still very early and under active development, I am not going to write documentation about how much of the planned project features are completed, so this is the best source of documentation about the project for now.
